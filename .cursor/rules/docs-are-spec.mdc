Write documentation as a specification.

Documentation MUST state clear, final decisions and requirements.

Documentation MUST NOT include:
- Recommendations or advice.
- Options or alternatives.
- Speculation or uncertainty.
- Future-facing placeholders.

Documentation MUST use definitive language that can be implemented and tested:
- Requirement keywords: MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHOULD. Use SHOULD only when a requirement level is intended.
- Exact behavior, constraints, and interfaces.
