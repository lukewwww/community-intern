Write documentation as a specification.

Documentation must state clear, final decisions and requirements.

Do not include:
- Recommendations or advice ("recommended", "best practice", "should consider")
- Options or alternatives ("either A or B", "you can choose", "optionally")
- Speculation or uncertainty ("might", "maybe", "could", "likely")
- Future-facing placeholders ("we may add later", "in the future")

Use definitive language that can be implemented and tested:
- "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHOULD" (only when a requirement level is intended)
- Exact behavior, constraints, and interfaces
