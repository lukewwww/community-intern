Do not add conversation-specific explanations, notes, or meta commentary into any generated or edited files.

Only write the final intended content for the project, as if the file stands alone.

Avoid adding text like:
- "(summary)"
- "(changed X to Y)"
- "(only write B)"

In fact, DO NOT add any parenthetical explanation at all!
